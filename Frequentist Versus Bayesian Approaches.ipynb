    "A positive test result is **not** \"statistically significant\" at the 𝑝<0.05 level because the false positive rate is exactly 5%, which is exactly the same as the alpha/ significance level of p=0.05. Therefore, one cannot confidently reject the null hypothesis. \n",

    " * False Positive: 1000 x (1000-6)/1000 x 0.05 = 49.7\n",
    " In a 1000 person sample, someone receiving a positive HIV test can only be 10.77% confident (6/(49.7+6) = 0.1077) that it correctly indicates they have HIV. Therefore, the test is not \"statistically significant\" at the p<0.05 level. "

What you should notice is that the PROPORTION INFECTED GIVEN A POSITIVE TEST depends (a lot!) on the OVERALL RATE OF INFECTION.
