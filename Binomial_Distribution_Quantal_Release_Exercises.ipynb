    "Let's say you know that a given nerve terminal contains exactly 14 quanta available for release. You have read in the literature that the release probability of these quanta is low, say 0.1. To assess whether this value is reasonable, you run a simple experiment: activate the nerve and measure the number of quanta that are released. The result is 8 quanta. What is the probability that you would get this result (8 quanta) if the true probability of release really was 0.1? What about if the true release probability was much higher; say, 0.7? What about for each decile of release probability (0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0)? Which value of release probability did you determine to be the most probable, given your measurement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: here you are computing a likelihood function: a function describing how the value of the conditional probability p(data | parameters) changes when you hold your data fixed to the value(s) you measured and vary the value(s) of the parameter(s) of, in this case, the binomial distribution. Because you are varying the parameters and not the data, the values of the function are not expected to sum to one (e.g., you can have numerous parameters that have a very high probability of producing the given data) and thus this function is not a probability distribution (see here for an extended discussion). The maximum value of this function is called the maximum likelihood."

Your sample size has now doubled, to two measurements.

To do so, assume that the two measurements in this sample are independent of one another; that is, the value of each result had no bearing on the other.

    "Let's say that you have run an exhaustive set of experiments on this synapse and have determined that the true release probability is 0.3 (within some very small tolerance). Now you want to test whether changing the temperature of the preparation affects the release probability. So you change the temperature, perform the experiment, and measure 7 quantal events for the same 14 available quanta. Compute  𝑝̂  . Standard statistical inference now asks the question, what is the probability that you would have obtained that measurement given a Null Hypothesis of no effect? In this case, no effect corresponds to an unchanged value of the true release probability (i.e., its value remained at 0.3 even with the temperature change). What is the probability that you would have gotten that measurement if your Null Hypothesis were true? Can you conclude that temperature had an effect?"
